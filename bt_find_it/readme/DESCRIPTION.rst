This module installs an emoji game in your local database. The game is fully working on Owl front-end framework
and it's meant to be used as a playground where to experiment and lear this new (in fact currently not as new)
framework.

The game consists in finding a given emoji between a soup of randon emojis. Everytime you find all the occurrences
of that emoji a new one will be chosen to search, and the mess of emojis will be refreshed. Your findings are
counted as points and you can just make three mistakes, otherwise your game is concluded.

By the way, you will just have 30 seconds for every game, so hurry up! :).
